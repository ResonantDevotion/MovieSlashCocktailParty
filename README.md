# MovieSlashCocktailParty
Creating an app that allows a user to select cocktails to watch with specific movies.

## Description 
This was a team project by "The Lost".

We identified a desperate need in the market. People were systematically failing to choose the correct movie to be shown at their parties, and even more concerning, they didn’t know which cocktail would enhance the experience.

Our goals were:
    - To use both a cocktail and movie API to enhance party planning,
    - The use client-side storage to allow users to save combinations   they like,
    - To use bootstrap and modals to show a modern, well organised website,
    - Most importantly, we wanted user input to dictate the response.


We used the following technologies while adopting an agile workflow:

    - Github
    - Visual Studio Code
        - JavaScript
        - HTML
        - CSS
        - Bootstrap
        
*** Disclaimer: some cocktails do not get displayed properly when saved. We have diagnosed that this is due to the API naming synatx which for a few cocktails is different than the others. Additionally, upon first use of the application, if you inspect and open up the console, there will be some errors, this is to be ignored and will fix itself once the application is first used.
