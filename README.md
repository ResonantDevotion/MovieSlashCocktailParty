# MovieSlashCocktailParty
Creating an app that allows a user to select cocktails to watch with specific movies.

## Description 

This project was a team collaboration task to design and create a web app from scratch that solves a real-world problem such as 'How can I impress my date on a netflix and chill night?'.
This projects involved adding two server APIs, local storage, and bootstrap, as well as using wireframing, html, css, and javascript.
This project was also used to allow us to practice agile development methodologies, git branch workflow, collaboration and our presentation skills.
